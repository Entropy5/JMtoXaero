# JMtoXaero

**JMtoXaero** is a tool to convert [JourneyMap](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/journeymap) tiles to regions used by [Xaero's World Map](https://chocolateminecraft.com/worldmap.php)

# Description 

- Reads images from the Journeymap folder
- Writes Xaero regions that are relevant for multiplayer maps (Singleplayer maps don't need this conversion, Xaero's mod will just automap everything over time)
- Confirmed to work with XaerosWorldMap_1.22.0_Forge_1.12.jar
- Uses the Journeymap colormapping to decode what block likely generated each pixel
- Visual difference is significant, as Journeymap pixel colors are also affected by height level, shading, transparency, and biomes

# Usage

Download the latest jar from releases

`java -jar JMtoXaero-2.0.jar <input folder> <output folder> <dimension> (-1, 0, 1, all)`

Input folder should point to your journeymap singleplayer or multiplayer data folder, where DIM0 etc resides.
